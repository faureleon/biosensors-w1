Jeudi 19 janvier : 


Wet lab material : 
* 13 syringes + 15 needles + 2mmØ tubes
* Blue ink
* Water
* Egeria densa 


OpenLab material : 
* 13 boxes with 4 circle openings for 4 red LEDs, for each syringe.
* 1 photoreceptor or photoresistance
* 3 arduinos
* Cables
* 15 * 4 red LEDs - White LEDs (a few)
* One power source : computer


Protocols :


* Design of the boxes :  
* Design 13 boxes with 3mm medium, with www.makercase.com
                                (our boxes are x x x)
* Put hole in it, where you want the LED to light up and where the needle will go out of the box. 
* Cut it with a laser cuter. 
* When the boxes are cut, build them and scotch all the angle with an opac scotch so that no light can go through and you have complet darkness.


















Drawings of the plans to design our boxes : 4 boxes can be cut with this plan

* WetLab protocol :


* Fill the syringe with 60 mL of water
* Add 7 cm of the top of the Egeria densa 
* Remove any air that might be inside the syringe
* Add 8 drops of blue ink to 250 ml of water with another syringe
* Fill the 2mm tube with the solution of water and ink until it is full
* Do NOT plug the tube with the syringe containing Egeria densa otherwise, the reaction will start before you will take the measures. 
* Scotch the tube on the bench so that it will not move when doing the experiment
* On the tube, write two marks spaced by 6cm
* Now you can plug the tube full of ink with the syringe with Egeria densa. 
* As soon as the air passed by the first mark, you can start measuring the time
* Stop the timer when the air passed by the second mark
